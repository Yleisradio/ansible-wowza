# ansible-wowza
## Wowza role for Ansible
This role automates the installation of the Wowza Media Server, including their installer, which contains an interminably
long EULA, and 5 interactive prompts.

# Requirements
- Java jdk - I use Oracle Java 7, but openjdk will be just fine.
- Wowza license - this you will get when you sign up for a free trial.
- Wowza binary - You can download this off of the Wowza site (http://www.wowza.com/pricing/installer), and I'll be including one, soon.

# Distros tested
Currently, this is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but as time allows, I'll be testing it on other distros/versions.
