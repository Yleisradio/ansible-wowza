# ansible-wowza
Wowza role for Ansible

# Requirements
-Java jdk - I use Oracle Java 7, but openjdk will be just fine.
-Wowza license - this you will get when you sign up for a free trial.
-Wowza binary - You can download this off of the Wowza site, and I'll be including one, soon.

# Distros tested
Currently, this is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, but as time allows, I'll be testing it on other distros/versions.
